# homework-py

## NOTICE

Only one singular school's renweb has been confirmed as being supported in initial requests. (This repo is very experiementaldjnkdjnsd) 

Hallo!! Homework-py is an abstraction over many SIS[^1] simple ways of feeding assignment data into a student's many electronic planners.

## Why is this existing when this has been solved before?

It is an educational project that I had passion for, so I chose to begin it despite knowing it could bear little fruit :).

**Aside from being a simple and *pointless-ish* educational project,** the main reasons I started this are found [here](reasons.md).

## Awesome dependencies of this library(!!)

(epicly doesn't have time to list them yet) (epicly puts on shades to express coolness factor)

### TODO

- [x] Basic Support for Moodle Calendar OOP Processing

> From my knowledge of (nothingness...) OOP, the library should be using a very basic form of OOP as of the first release. I am not sure though. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

- [ ] Implement Same parsing structure for Canvas LMS
- [ ] Implement seperate data flagging for Renweb's calendar
- [ ] Clean up code with formatting and formatting
- [ ] Setup as a python package
- [ ] Release! (as a standard version with correct semantic versioning)
