## NOTICE

This is an unofficial wrapper for FACTS SIS Renweb. It utilizes a combination of web scraping and data parsing to objectify student data. There are plans to branch out to other services like Canvas, Moodle, and Google Classroom.

### Why is this existing when this has been solved before?

It is an educational project that I had passion for, so I chose to begin it despite knowing it could bear little fruit :).

**Aside from being a simple and *pointless-ish* educational project,** the main reasons I started this are found [here](reasons.md).

### Awesome dependencies of this library(!!)

(epicly doesn't have time to list them yet) (epicly puts on shades to express coolness factor)

### TODO

- [x] Basic Support for Moodle Calendar OOP Processing (although this is a renweb wrapper, I have plans to expand it into accepting other services. Canvas, Moodle, Google Classroom)

> From my knowledge of (nothingness...) OOP, the library should be using a very basic form of OOP as of the first release. I am not sure though. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

### Features

- [x] Implement seperate data flagging for Renweb's calendar (PT 1)
- [x] Implement seperate data flagging for Renweb's calendar (PT 2)
- [x] Implement Renweb Report Card Data Extraction 
- [x] Clean up code with formatting and formatting
- [x] Setup as a python package
